## 🌌 About the Project
*Project X* is a *fusion of Cybersecurity + AI + Data Visualization, built to compete in **Tableau Next Hackathon 2025*.  
It is designed to:  
- Detect 🔍 vulnerabilities in real-time.

## 🎯 Inspiration
Every great hack starts with a story.  
We asked ourselves:  
> "What if cybersecurity could be understood by everyone, not just experts?"  

From that spark, *Project X* was born — *a canvas of defense*, where threats are painted as patterns and insights emerge like constellations.
